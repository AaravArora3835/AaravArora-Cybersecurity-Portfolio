# Reflection

This portfolio represents my early hands-on exploration of cybersecurity.

I began with foundational coursework and then shifted toward practical,
lab-based learning to better understand how security concepts apply in
real-world systems. My focus moving forward is consistency, depth, and
building strong fundamentals through hands-on experience.
